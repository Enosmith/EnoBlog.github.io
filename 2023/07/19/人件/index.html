Failing</h1><h2 id="The-Name-of-the-Game"><a href="#The-Name-of-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="The Name of the Game"></a>The Name of the Game</h2><p>The cause of failure most frequently cited by our survey participants was “politics.” But now observe that people tend to use this word rather sloppily.Included under “politics” are such unrelated or loosely related things as communication problems, staffing problems, disenchantment with the boss or with the client, lack of motivation, and high turnover. People often use the word politics to describe any aspect of the work that is people-related, but the English language provides a much more precise term for these effects: They constitute the project’s sociology. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most managers are willing to concede the idea that they’ve got more people worries than technical worries. But they seldom manage that way.   </p>
<p>Part of this phenomenon is due to the upbringing of the average manager. He or she was schooled in how the job is done, not how the job is managed.  </p>
<h2 id="The-High-Tech-Illusion"><a href="#The-High-Tech-Illusion" class="headerlink" title="The High-Tech Illusion"></a>The High-Tech Illusion</h2><p>The researchers who made fundamental breakthroughs in those areas are in a high-tech business. The rest of us are appliers of their work. We use computers and other new technology components to develop our products or to organize our affairs. Because we go about this work in teams and projects and other tightly knit working groups, we are mostly in the human communication business. Our successes stem from good human interactions by all participants in the effort, and our failures stem from poor human interactions.  </p>
<p>The main reason we tend to focus on the technical rather than the human side of the work is not because it’s more crucial, but because it’s easier to do. Getting the new disk drive installed is positively trivial compared to figuring out why Horace is in a blue funk or why Susan is dissatisfied with the company after only a few months. Human interactions are complicated and never very crisp and clean in their effects, but they matter more than any other aspect of the work.  </p>
<p>If you find yourself concentrating on the technology rather than the sociology, you’re like the vaudeville character who loses his keys on a dark street and looks for them on the adjacent street because, as he explains, “The light is better there.”  </p>
<h1 id="Make-a-Cheeseburger-Sell-a-Cheeseburger"><a href="#Make-a-Cheeseburger-Sell-a-Cheeseburger" class="headerlink" title="Make a Cheeseburger,Sell a Cheeseburger"></a>Make a Cheeseburger,Sell a Cheeseburger</h1><p>• Squeeze out error. Make the machine (the human machine) run as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>• Take a hard line about people goofing off on the job.</p>
<p>• Treat workers as interchangeable pieces of the machine.</p>
<p>• Optimize the steady state. (Don’t even think about how the operation got up to speed, or what it would take to close it down.)</p>
<p>• Standardize procedure. Do everything by the book.</p>
<p>• Eliminate experimentation—that’s what the folks at headquarters are paid for.</p>
<p>The “make a cheeseburger, sell a cheeseburger” mentality can be fatal in your development area. It can only serve to damp your people’s spirits and focus their attention away from the real problems at hand. This style of management will be directly at odds with the work.  </p>
<p>To manage thinking workers effectively, you need to take measures nearly opposite those listed above.  </p>
<h2 id="A-Quota-for-Errors"><a href="#A-Quota-for-Errors" class="headerlink" title="A Quota for Errors"></a>A Quota for Errors</h2><p>For most thinking workers, making an occasional mistake is a natural and healthy part of their work. But there can be an almost Biblical association<br>between error on the job and sin. This is an attitude we need to take specific pains to change.  </p>

<p>Speaking to a group of software managers, we introduced a strategy for what we think of as iterative design. The idea is that some designs are intrinsically defect-prone; they ought to be rejected, not repaired. Such dead ends should be expected in the design activity. The lost effort of the dead end is a small price to pay for a clean, fresh start. To our surprise, many managers felt this would pose an impossible political problem for their own bosses: “How can we throw away a product that our company has paid to produce?” They seemed to believe that they’d be better off salvaging the defective version even though it might cost more in the long run.  </p>
<p>Fostering an atmosphere that doesn’t allow for error simply makes people defensive. They don’t try things that may turn out badly. You encourage this defensiveness when you try to systematize the process, when you impose rigid methodologies so that staff members are not allowed to make any of the key strategic decisions lest they make them incorrectly. The average level of technology may be modestly improved by any steps you take to inhibit error. The team sociology, however, can suffer grievously.  </p>
<p>The opposite approach would be to encourage people to make some errors. You do this by asking your folks on occasion what dead-end roads they’ve been down, and by making sure they understand that “none” is not the best answer. When people blow it, they should be congratulated—that’s part of what they’re being paid for.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>鼓励尝试，并且鼓励分享自己尝试出错的经验经历，“没有问题”“没有错误”这绝对不是最完美的答案。</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="The-People-Store"><a href="#The-People-Store" class="headerlink" title="The People Store"></a>The People Store</h2><p>In a production environment, it’s convenient to think of people as parts of the machine. When a part wears out, you get another. The replacement part is interchangeable with the original. You order a new one, more or less, by number.  </p>
<p>Many development managers adopt the same attitude. They go to great lengths to convince themselves that no one is irreplaceable. Because they<br>fear that a key person will leave, they force themselves to believe that there is no such thing as a key person. Isn’t that the essence of management, after all, to make sure that the work goes on whether the individuals stay or not? They act as though there were a magical People Store they could call up and say, “Send me a new George Gardenhyer, but make him a little less uppity.”  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>人力，并不是一种可以直接替换的元器件，并不是一个简单的数字而已</p>
<p>我们将它简化成一个数字，有时候是因为我们害怕直面关键人物的可替代性到底有多少。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The uniqueness of every worker is a continued annoyance to the manager who has blindly adopted a management style from the production world. The natural people manager, on the other hand, realizes that uniqueness is what makes project chemistry vital and effective. It’s something to be cultivated.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>盲目的管理者用统一的方式管理所有人，而人性化的管理者却能认识到正是这种独特性使得项目团队产生了化学反应，是团队充满活力与高效的源泉。</p>
<p><strong>疑问——这种特殊性和因人而异的管理成本，以及对其他人的暗示作用带来的负面影响怎么排除？</strong></p>

We pay far too little attention to how well each of them fits into the effort as a whole.  </p>
<p>The catalyst is important because the project is always in a state of flux. Someone who can help a project to jell is worth two people who just do work.  </p>

We spent far too much of our time trying to get things done and not nearly enough time asking the key question, , “Ought this thing to be done at all?” The steady-state cheeseburger mentality barely even pays lip service to the idea of thinking on the job. Its every inclination is to push the effort into 100-percent do-mode. If an excuse is needed for the lack of think-time, the excuse is always time pressure—as though there were ever work to be done without time pressure.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>我们总是在忙，总是在干活，却很少思考，比如我知道的某个人，我感觉就总是在做第一象限的事情，我觉得是事倍功半的。</p>

<h1 id="Vienna-Waits-for-You"><a href="#Vienna-Waits-for-You" class="headerlink" title="Vienna Waits for You"></a>Vienna Waits for You</h1><p>For all the talk about “working smarter,” there is a widespread sense that what real-world management is all about is getting people to work harder and longer, largely at the expense of their personal lives. Managers are forever tooting their horns about the quantity of overtime their people put in, and the tricks one can use to get even more out of them.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>我们好像总是习惯吹嘘加班时长…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Productivity ought to mean achieving more in an hour of work, but all too often it has come to mean extracting more for an hour of pay. There is a large difference.   The Spanish Theory managers dream of attaining new productivity levels through the simple mechanism of unpaid overtime. They divide whatever work is done in a week by forty hours, not by the eighty or ninety hours that the worker actually put in.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>工作效率应该是指单位时间内产生更多的效益，而不是靠加班时长堆积</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s not exactly productivity—it’s more like fraud—but it’s the state of the art for many American managers. They bully and cajole their people into<br>long hours. They impress upon them how important the delivery date is (even though it may be totally arbitrary; the world isn’t going to stop just because<br>a project completes a month late). They trick them into accepting hopelessly tight schedules, shame them into sacrificing any and all to meet the deadline, and do anything to get them to work longer and harder.  </p>

<p>Overtime is like sprinting: It makes some sense for the last hundred yards of the marathon for those with any energy left, but if you start sprinting in<br>the first mile, you’re just wasting time. Trying to get people to sprint too much can only result in loss of respect for the manager. The best workers have been through it all before; they know enough to keep silent and roll their eyes while the manager raves on that the job has got to get done by April. Then they take their compensatory undertime when they can, and end up putting in forty hours of real work each week. The best workers react that way; the others are workaholics.  </p>

It makes the person who has unwittingly sacrificed seek revenge. He doesn’t go to the boss and explain calmly and thoughtfully that things have to change in the future—he just quits, another case of burnout. One way or the other, he’s gone.</p>

<ul>
<li>Pressure people to put in more hours.</li>
<li>Mechanize the process of product development.</li>
<li>Compromise the quality of the product (more about this in the next<br>chapter).</li>
<li>Standardize procedures.</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That doesn’t say you can’t improve productivity without paying a turnover price. It only says you need to take turnover into account whenever you set out to attain higher productivity. Otherwise, you may achieve an “improvement” that is more than offset by the loss of your key people.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>当你想靠加班提高生产率时，你就得考虑人员的得失了，是否能取得平衡</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most organizations don’t even keep statistics on turnover. Virtually none can tell you what replacement of an experienced worker costs. And whenever productivity is considered, it is done as though turnover were nonexistent or cost-free. The Eagle project at Data General was a case in point. The project was a Spanish Theory triumph: Workaholic project members put in endless unpaid overtime hours to push productivity to unheard of levels. At the end of the project, virtually the entire development staff quit. What was the cost of that? No one even figured it into the equation.  </p>

She was summoned in front of the management committee and was asked for a progress report. She said she could guarantee that her product would be ready by the deadline of March 1, exactly on time according to the original estimate. The upper managers chewed over that piece of unexpected good news and then called her in again the next day. Since she was on time for March 1, they explained, the deadline had been moved up to January 15.  </p>
<blockquote>

<p>What’s not so easy is keeping in mind an inconvenient truth like this one:</p>
<p><strong>People under time pressure don’t work better—they just work faster.</strong></p>
<p>In order to work faster, they may have to sacrifice the quality of the product and of their own work experience  </p>

<p>Workers kept under extreme time pressure will begin to sacrifice quality. They will push problems under the rug to be dealt with later or foisted off<br>onto the product’s end user.

<p>With sublime irony, this disastrous record is often blamed on poor quality consciousness of the builders. That is, those same folks who are chided for being inclined to “tinker forever with a program, all in the name of ‘Quality’” are also getting blamed when quality is low.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>讽刺的是，当产品质量很低时，那些原想提高质量但迫于时间压力的员工又受到指责。</p>

<p>We have to assume that the people who pay for our work are of sound enough mind to make a sensible trade-off between quality and cost.  Reducing the quality of a product is likely to cause some people not to buy, but the reduced market penetration that results from virtually any such quality reduction will often be more than offset by increased profit on each item sold.  </p>

<p><strong>Quality, far beyond that required by the end user, is a means to higher productivity</strong>  </p>
<p>If you doubt that notion, imagine the following gedankenexperiment: Ask a hundred people on the street what organization or culture or nation is famous for high quality. We predict that more than half the people today would answer, “Japan.” Now ask a different hundred people what organization or culture or nation is famous for high productivity. Again, the majority can be expected to mention, “Japan.” The nation that is an acknowledged quality<br>leader is also known for its high productivity.  </p>

<p>Hewlett-Packard has long been an example of an organization that reaps the benefits from increased productivity due to high, builder-set quality standards. From its beginning, the company has made a cult of quality. In such an environment, the argument that more time or money is needed to produce a high-quality product is generally not heard. The result is that developers know they are part of a culture that delivers quality beyond what the  marketplace requires. Their sense of quality identification works for increased job satisfaction and some of the lowest turnover figures seen anywhere in the industry.  </p>

No matter that the client would be willing to accept even a substandard product, the team can insist that delivery wait until its own standards are achieved. Of course, project managers are under the same pressure there that they are here: They’re being pressed to deliver something, anything, right away. But enough of a quality culture has been built up so that these Japanese managers know better than to bully their<br>workers into settling for lower quality.  </p>

<p>Bad estimates, hopelessly tight estimates, sap the builders’ energy. Capers Jones, known for his metric studies of development projects, puts it this way: “When the schedule for a project is totally unreasonable and unrealistic, and no amount of overtime can allow it to be made, the project team becomes angry and frustrated . . . and morale drops to the bottom.”1 It doesn’t matter too terribly much whether the “totally unreasonable and unrealistic” schedule comes from the boss or from the builders themselves.

<p>The decision to apply schedule pressure to a project needs to be made in much the same way you decide whether or not to punish your child: If punishment is rare and your timing is impeccable so the justification is easily apparent, then maybe it can help.

<ol>
<li>There is some new trick you’ve missed that could send productivity soaring.</li>
</ol>
<p>Response: You are simply not dumb enough to have missed something so fundamental. You are continually investigating new approaches and trying out the ones that make the most sense. None of the measures you’ve taken or are likely to take can actually make productivity soar. What they do, though, is to keep everybody healthy: People like to keep their minds engaged, to learn, and to improve. The line that there is some magical innovation out there that you’ve missed is a pure fear tactic, employed by those with a vested interest in selling it.  </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Other managers are getting gains of 100 percent or 200 percent or more!</li>
</ol>
<p>Response: Forget it. The typical magical tool that’s touted to you is focused on the coding and testing part of the life cycle. But even if coding and testing went away entirely, you couldn’t expect a gain of 100 percent. There is still all the analysis, negotiation, specification, training, acceptance testing, conversion, and cutover to be done.  </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Technology is moving so swiftly that you’re being passed by.</li>
</ol>
<p>Response: Yes, technology is moving swiftly, but (the High-Tech Illusion again) most of what you’re doing is not truly high-tech work. While the machines have changed enormously, the business of software development has been rather static. We still spend most of our time working on requirements and specification, the low-tech part of our work. Productivity within the software industry has improved by 3 to 5 percent a year, only marginally better than the steel or automobile industry.  </p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Changing languages will give you huge gains.</li>
</ol>
<p>Response: Languages are important because they affect the way you think about a problem, but again, they can have impact only on the implementation part of the project. Because of their exaggerated claims, some of our newer languages qualify as laetrile. Sure, it may be better to implement a new feature in Java, for example, rather than PHP, but even before Java came along, there were better ways to do whatever you needed to do: niche tools that made certain classes of function pretty easy to implement. Unless you’ve been asleep at the switch for the past few decades, change of a language won’t do much for you. It might give you a 5-percent gain (nothing to sneeze at), but not more.  </p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Because of the backlog（未完成&#x2F;启动的项目，库存的项目）, you need to double productivity immediately.</li>
</ol>
<p>Response: The much talked about software backlog is a myth. We all know that projects cost a lot more at the end than what we expected<br>them to cost at the beginning. So the cost of a system that didn’t get built this year (because we didn’t have the capacity for it) is optimistically assumed to be half of what it would actually cost to build, or even less. The typical project that’s stuck in the mythical backlog is there because it has barely enough benefit to justify building it, even with the most optimistic cost assumptions. If we knew its real cost, we’d see that project for what it is: an economic loser. It shouldn’t be in the backlog, it should be in the reject pile.  </p>
<ol start="6">
<li>You automate everything else; isn’t it about time you automated away your software development staff?</li>
</ol>
<p>Response: This is another variation of the High-Tech Illusion: the belief that software developers do easily automatable work. Their principal work is human communication to organize the users’ expressions of needs into formal procedure. That work will be necessary no matter how we change the life cycle. And it’s not likely to be automated.  </p>
<ol start="7">
<li>Your people will work better if you put them under a lot of pressure.</li>

Sharon came in and found me propped up at the console. She disappeared and came back a few minutes later with a container of soup.

One guy was so offended by these notes that he could barely restrain his anger. Knowing how he felt, his fellow workers played a joke on him: They bought a picture frame from the local five-and-dime store, choosing one with a photograph of an allAmerican family as a sample. Then they replaced the photo of his own family with the other.

<p>Basement space is really preferable from the point of view of the Furniture Police, because it lends itself more readily to uniform layouts. But people<br>work better in natural light. They feel better in windowed space and that feeling translates directly into higher quality of work. People don’t want to work in a perfectly uniform space either.

<p>Visiting a few dozen different organizations each year, as we do, quickly convinces you that ignoring such inconvenient facts is intrinsic to many<br>office plans. Almost without exception, the work space given to intellect workers is noisy, interruptive, un-private, and sterile. Some are prettier than<br>others, but not much more functional. No one can get much real work done there.

<p>Now, why is that so important? Because even though the pairs didn’t work together, the two members of the pair came from the same organization. (In most cases, they were the only ones from that organization.) They worked in the same physical environment and shared the same corporate culture. The fact that they had nearly identical performances suggests that the wide spread of capabilities observed across the whole sample may not apply within the organization: Two people from the same organization tend to perform alike. That means the best performers are clustering in some organizations while the worst performers are clustering in others. This is the effect that software pioneer Harlan Mills predicted in 1981:  </p>
<p>While this [10 to 1] productivity differential among programmers is understandable, there is also a 10 to 1 difference in productivity among software organizations.  </p>

<p>Managers for years have affected a certain fatalism about individual differences. They reasoned that the differences were innate, so you couldn’t do much about them. It’s harder to be fatalistic about the clustering effect. Some companies are doing a lot worse than others. Something about their environment and corporate culture is failing to attract and keep good people or is making it impossible for even good people to work effectively.  </p>

<p>As a result, we cannot distinguish between those who worked in a genuinely quiet workplace and those who were well adapted to (not bothered by) a noisy workplace.

<p>一般需要一个缓慢的过程来进入状态，15分钟或更长时间的集中才能把自己锁定在流里面。在这个引入过程中，你对噪声和干扰是非常敏感的。每次被打断后，就需要再一个引入过程来使你回到流的状态，而在引入过程中，你并不是真正在工作。</p>

<p>与工作有效性降低一样严重的是随之而来的焦躁。</p>

<p>Second, it creates a record of how meaningful time is applied to the work. If a product is projected to require three thousand flow hours to complete,<br>then you’ve got a valid reason to believe you’re two-thirds done when two thousand flow hours have been logged against it.
