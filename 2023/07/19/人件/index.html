Failing</h1><h2 id="The-Name-of-the-Game"><a href="#The-Name-of-the-Game" class="headerlink" title="The Name of the Game"></a>The Name of the Game</h2><p>The cause of failure most frequently cited by our survey participants was “politics.” But now observe that people tend to use this word rather sloppily.Included under “politics” are such unrelated or loosely related things as communication problems, staffing problems, disenchantment with the boss or with the client, lack of motivation, and high turnover. People often use the word politics to describe any aspect of the work that is people-related, but the English language provides a much more precise term for these effects: They constitute the project’s sociology. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The major problems of our work are not so much technological as sociological in nature.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most managers are willing to concede the idea that they’ve got more people worries than technical worries. But they seldom manage that way.   </p>
<p>Part of this phenomenon is due to the upbringing of the average manager. He or she was schooled in how the job is done, not how the job is managed.  </p>
<h2 id="The-High-Tech-Illusion"><a href="#The-High-Tech-Illusion" class="headerlink" title="The High-Tech Illusion"></a>The High-Tech Illusion</h2><p>The researchers who made fundamental breakthroughs in those areas are in a high-tech business. The rest of us are appliers of their work. We use computers and other new technology components to develop our products or to organize our affairs. Because we go about this work in teams and projects and other tightly knit working groups, we are mostly in the human communication business. Our successes stem from good human interactions by all participants in the effort, and our failures stem from poor human interactions.  </p>
<p>The main reason we tend to focus on the technical rather than the human side of the work is not because it’s more crucial, but because it’s easier to do. Getting the new disk drive installed is positively trivial compared to figuring out why Horace is in a blue funk or why Susan is dissatisfied with the company after only a few months. Human interactions are complicated and never very crisp and clean in their effects, but they matter more than any other aspect of the work.  </p>
<p>If you find yourself concentrating on the technology rather than the sociology, you’re like the vaudeville character who loses his keys on a dark street and looks for them on the adjacent street because, as he explains, “The light is better there.”  </p>
<h1 id="Make-a-Cheeseburger-Sell-a-Cheeseburger"><a href="#Make-a-Cheeseburger-Sell-a-Cheeseburger" class="headerlink" title="Make a Cheeseburger,Sell a Cheeseburger"></a>Make a Cheeseburger,Sell a Cheeseburger</h1><p>• Squeeze out error. Make the machine (the human machine) run as smoothly as possible.</p>
<p>• Take a hard line about people goofing off on the job.</p>
<p>• Treat workers as interchangeable pieces of the machine.</p>
<p>• Optimize the steady state. (Don’t even think about how the operation got up to speed, or what it would take to close it down.)</p>
<p>• Standardize procedure. Do everything by the book.</p>
<p>• Eliminate experimentation—that’s what the folks at headquarters are paid for.</p>
<p>The “make a cheeseburger, sell a cheeseburger” mentality can be fatal in your development area. It can only serve to damp your people’s spirits and focus their attention away from the real problems at hand. This style of management will be directly at odds with the work.  </p>
<p>To manage thinking workers effectively, you need to take measures nearly opposite those listed above.  </p>
<h2 id="A-Quota-for-Errors"><a href="#A-Quota-for-Errors" class="headerlink" title="A Quota for Errors"></a>A Quota for Errors</h2><p>For most thinking workers, making an occasional mistake is a natural and healthy part of their work. But there can be an almost Biblical association<br>between error on the job and sin. This is an attitude we need to take specific pains to change.  </p>

<p>Speaking to a group of software managers, we introduced a strategy for what we think of as iterative design. The idea is that some designs are intrinsically defect-prone; they ought to be rejected, not repaired. Such dead ends should be expected in the design activity. The lost effort of the dead end is a small price to pay for a clean, fresh start. To our surprise, many managers felt this would pose an impossible political problem for their own bosses: “How can we throw away a product that our company has paid to produce?” They seemed to believe that they’d be better off salvaging the defective version even though it might cost more in the long run.  </p>
<p>Fostering an atmosphere that doesn’t allow for error simply makes people defensive. They don’t try things that may turn out badly. You encourage this defensiveness when you try to systematize the process, when you impose rigid methodologies so that staff members are not allowed to make any of the key strategic decisions lest they make them incorrectly. The average level of technology may be modestly improved by any steps you take to inhibit error. The team sociology, however, can suffer grievously.  </p>
<p>The opposite approach would be to encourage people to make some errors. You do this by asking your folks on occasion what dead-end roads they’ve been down, and by making sure they understand that “none” is not the best answer. When people blow it, they should be congratulated—that’s part of what they’re being paid for.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>鼓励尝试，并且鼓励分享自己尝试出错的经验经历，“没有问题”“没有错误”这绝对不是最完美的答案。</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="The-People-Store"><a href="#The-People-Store" class="headerlink" title="The People Store"></a>The People Store</h2><p>In a production environment, it’s convenient to think of people as parts of the machine. When a part wears out, you get another. The replacement part is interchangeable with the original. You order a new one, more or less, by number.  </p>
<p>Many development managers adopt the same attitude. They go to great lengths to convince themselves that no one is irreplaceable. Because they<br>fear that a key person will leave, they force themselves to believe that there is no such thing as a key person. Isn’t that the essence of management, after all, to make sure that the work goes on whether the individuals stay or not? They act as though there were a magical People Store they could call up and say, “Send me a new George Gardenhyer, but make him a little less uppity.”  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>人力，并不是一种可以直接替换的元器件，并不是一个简单的数字而已</p>
<p>我们将它简化成一个数字，有时候是因为我们害怕直面关键人物的可替代性到底有多少。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The uniqueness of every worker is a continued annoyance to the manager who has blindly adopted a management style from the production world. The natural people manager, on the other hand, realizes that uniqueness is what makes project chemistry vital and effective. It’s something to be cultivated.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>盲目的管理者用统一的方式管理所有人，而人性化的管理者却能认识到正是这种独特性使得项目团队产生了化学反应，是团队充满活力与高效的源泉。</p>
<p><strong>疑问——这种特殊性和因人而异的管理成本，以及对其他人的暗示作用带来的负面影响怎么排除？</strong></p>

We pay far too little attention to how well each of them fits into the effort as a whole.  </p>
<p>The catalyst is important because the project is always in a state of flux. Someone who can help a project to jell is worth two people who just do work.  </p>

We spent far too much of our time trying to get things done and not nearly enough time asking the key question, , “Ought this thing to be done at all?” The steady-state cheeseburger mentality barely even pays lip service to the idea of thinking on the job. Its every inclination is to push the effort into 100-percent do-mode. If an excuse is needed for the lack of think-time, the excuse is always time pressure—as though there were ever work to be done without time pressure.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>我们总是在忙，总是在干活，却很少思考，比如我知道的某个人，我感觉就总是在做第一象限的事情，我觉得是事倍功半的。</p>

<h1 id="Vienna-Waits-for-You"><a href="#Vienna-Waits-for-You" class="headerlink" title="Vienna Waits for You"></a>Vienna Waits for You</h1><p>For all the talk about “working smarter,” there is a widespread sense that what real-world management is all about is getting people to work harder and longer, largely at the expense of their personal lives. Managers are forever tooting their horns about the quantity of overtime their people put in, and the tricks one can use to get even more out of them.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>我们好像总是习惯吹嘘加班时长…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Productivity ought to mean achieving more in an hour of work, but all too often it has come to mean extracting more for an hour of pay. There is a large difference.   The Spanish Theory managers dream of attaining new productivity levels through the simple mechanism of unpaid overtime. They divide whatever work is done in a week by forty hours, not by the eighty or ninety hours that the worker actually put in.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>工作效率应该是指单位时间内产生更多的效益，而不是靠加班时长堆积</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s not exactly productivity—it’s more like fraud—but it’s the state of the art for many American managers. They bully and cajole their people into<br>long hours. They impress upon them how important the delivery date is (even though it may be totally arbitrary; the world isn’t going to stop just because<br>a project completes a month late). They trick them into accepting hopelessly tight schedules, shame them into sacrificing any and all to meet the deadline, and do anything to get them to work longer and harder.  </p>

<p>持续长时间工作对于脑力劳动者并不是好事</p>

<p>Overtime is like sprinting: It makes some sense for the last hundred yards of the marathon for those with any energy left, but if you start sprinting in<br>the first mile, you’re just wasting time. Trying to get people to sprint too much can only result in loss of respect for the manager. The best workers have been through it all before; they know enough to keep silent and roll their eyes while the manager raves on that the job has got to get done by April. Then they take their compensatory undertime when they can, and end up putting in forty hours of real work each week. The best workers react that way; the others are workaholics.  </p>

<p>对于老油条来说，让他们加班他们是懂得怎么滑水的…他们是best workers？可能我是工作狂吧</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Workaholics"><a href="#Workaholics" class="headerlink" title="Workaholics"></a>Workaholics</h2><p>The realization that one has sacrificed a more important value (family, love, home, youth) for a less important value (work) is devastating. It makes the person who has unwittingly sacrificed seek revenge. He doesn’t go to the boss and explain calmly and thoughtfully that things have to change in the future—he just quits, another case of burnout. One way or the other, he’s gone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>一旦工作狂了解到本质（即工作可能不值得他付出这么多），他会直接quit</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you exploit them to the hilt in typical Spanish Theory fashion, you’ll eventually lose them. No matter how desperately you need them to put in all those hours, you can’t let them do so at the expense of their personal lives.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>我就是例子，他们已经失去我了</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Productivity-Winning-Battles-and-Losing-Wars"><a href="#Productivity-Winning-Battles-and-Losing-Wars" class="headerlink" title="Productivity: Winning Battles and Losing Wars"></a>Productivity: Winning Battles and Losing Wars</h2><p>Consider some of the things that organizations typically do to improve productivity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pressure people to put in more hours.</li>
<li>Mechanize the process of product development.</li>
<li>Compromise the quality of the product (more about this in the next<br>chapter).</li>
<li>Standardize procedures.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>太真实了，哈哈哈哈</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn’t say you can’t improve productivity without paying a turnover price. It only says you need to take turnover into account whenever you set out to attain higher productivity. Otherwise, you may achieve an “improvement” that is more than offset by the loss of your key people.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>当你想靠加班提高生产率时，你就得考虑人员的得失了，是否能取得平衡</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most organizations don’t even keep statistics on turnover. Virtually none can tell you what replacement of an experienced worker costs. And whenever productivity is considered, it is done as though turnover were nonexistent or cost-free. The Eagle project at Data General was a case in point. The project was a Spanish Theory triumph: Workaholic project members put in endless unpaid overtime hours to push productivity to unheard of levels. At the end of the project, virtually the entire development staff quit. What was the cost of that? No one even figured it into the equation.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>活生生的例子</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="Reprise（反思）"><a href="#Reprise（反思）" class="headerlink" title="Reprise（反思）"></a>Reprise（反思）</h2><p>One of my early consults was a project that was proceeding so smoothly that the project manager knew she would deliver the product on schedule. She was summoned in front of the management committee and was asked for a progress report. She said she could guarantee that her product would be ready by the deadline of March 1, exactly on time according to the original estimate. The upper managers chewed over that piece of unexpected good news and then called her in again the next day. Since she was on time for March 1, they explained, the deadline had been moved up to January 15.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>很真实，有时候不要把消息报的太好了，时不时报点坏消息是有好处的，因为管理层永远觉得你有剩余价值可以被压榨，他们永远希望员工保持压力，如果你能完成，那么就是你工作量不够。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A schedule that the project could actually meet was of no value to those Spanish Theory managers, because it didn’t put the people under pressure.<br>Better to have a hopelessly impossible schedule to extract more labor from the workers.  </p>
<p>What’s not so easy is keeping in mind an inconvenient truth like this one:</p>
<p><strong>People under time pressure don’t work better—they just work faster.</strong></p>
<p>In order to work faster, they may have to sacrifice the quality of the product and of their own work experience  </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>他们不是工作得更好，只是工作得更快，代价是牺牲产品质量和个人体验</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Quality—If-Time-Permits"><a href="#Quality—If-Time-Permits" class="headerlink" title="Quality—If Time Permits"></a>Quality—If Time Permits</h1><p>There may be many and varied causes of emotional reaction in one’s personal life, but in the workplace, the major arouser of emotions is threatened self-esteem.  </p>
<p>We all tend to tie our self-esteem strongly to the quality of the product we produce—not the quantity of product, but the quality.  Any step you take that may jeopardize the quality of the product is likely to set the emotions of your staff directly against you.  </p>
<h2 id="The-Flight-from-Excellence"><a href="#The-Flight-from-Excellence" class="headerlink" title="The Flight from Excellence"></a>The Flight from Excellence</h2><p>Managers jeopardize product quality by setting unreachable deadlines. They don’t think about their action in such terms; they think rather that what they’re doing is throwing down an interesting challenge to their workers, something to help them strive for excellence.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>管理者总是误认为设置一个不可达的deadline能帮助员工激发潜能，事实上是在危害产品质量。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Workers kept under extreme time pressure will begin to sacrifice quality. They will push problems under the rug to be dealt with later or foisted off<br>onto the product’s end user. They will deliver products that are unstable and not really complete. They will hate what they’re doing, but what other choice<br>do they have?  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>员工是很无奈的…强行开发的产品充满隐患和不足</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In many cases, you may be right about the market, but the decision to pressure people into delivering a product that doesn’t measure up to their own quality standards is almost always a mistake.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>对于市场来说，也许确实需要速度，但是后续也会带来代价</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With sublime irony, this disastrous record is often blamed on poor quality consciousness of the builders. That is, those same folks who are chided for being inclined to “tinker forever with a program, all in the name of ‘Quality’” are also getting blamed when quality is low.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>讽刺的是，当产品质量很低时，那些原想提高质量但迫于时间压力的员工又受到指责。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By regularly putting the development process under extreme time pressure and then accepting poor-quality products, the software user community has shown its true quality standard.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>客户&#x2F;甲方接锅</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We have to assume that the people who pay for our work are of sound enough mind to make a sensible trade-off between quality and cost.  Reducing the quality of a product is likely to cause some people not to buy, but the reduced market penetration that results from virtually any such quality reduction will often be more than offset by increased profit on each item sold.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>如果产品质量堪忧，虽然每个单个产品的收益会变大，但从市场角度看是得不偿失</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Quality, far beyond that required by the end user, is a means to higher productivity</strong>  </p>
<p>If you doubt that notion, imagine the following gedankenexperiment: Ask a hundred people on the street what organization or culture or nation is famous for high quality. We predict that more than half the people today would answer, “Japan.” Now ask a different hundred people what organization or culture or nation is famous for high productivity. Again, the majority can be expected to mention, “Japan.” The nation that is an acknowledged quality<br>leader is also known for its high productivity.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>日本是质量决定产量最好的例子</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trade-off between price and quality does not exist in Japan. Rather, the idea that high quality brings on cost reduction is widely accepted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>日本人普遍接受，高质量带来成本降低的观点</p>
</blockquote>
